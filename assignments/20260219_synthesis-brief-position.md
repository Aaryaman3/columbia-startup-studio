**Submit via:** GitHub (public repo)

---

## What to Submit

Create a folder `20260219/` inside your team folder in the public repo:

```
teams/your-team-name/20260219/
```

Include the following:

### 1. Interview Synthesis Comparison Exercise

**Part A: Human Synthesis**

Your team's synthesis of the interviews for your chosen idea. Include:
- Key patterns across interviews
- Top 5 quotes (exact words from interviewees)
- Contradictions and what they might mean
- Surprises — what changed your thinking
- Your overall read on the data

**Part B: AI Synthesis**

Feed your interview snapshots **and** raw interview notes into an LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, or any model). Ask it to synthesize the data. Include the AI's full output.

**Part C: Comparison Reflection** (1-2 paragraphs)
- What did the AI find that you missed?
- What did you notice that the AI didn't?
- Where do you trust the AI's read? Where don't you?

**Important:** Do Part A **before** Part B. Develop your own read on the data before seeing the AI's.
