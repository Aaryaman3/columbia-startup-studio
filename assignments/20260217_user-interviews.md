# Submission: User Interview Materials

**Due:** Tuesday, February 17, 2026
**Submit via:** GitHub (public repo)

---

## What to Submit

Create a folder `20260217/` inside your team folder in the public repo:

```
teams/your-team-name/20260217/
```

Include the following:

### 1. Interview Scripts / Prep Documents

Your interview guide, question list, or any prep documents you used to run the interviews. This can be a single markdown file or multiple files.

### 2. Raw Interview Notes

The raw text from each interview. These are the notes you took during or immediately after each conversation. One file per interview is ideal, but a single combined file is fine too.

**Suggested naming:**
- `interview_01.md`
- `interview_02.md`
- etc.

### 3. Interview Snapshots (Quick Summaries)

The quick post-interview summaries you wrote after each interview. These are the snapshot documents from the template we provided in class.

## How to Submit

1. Create the `20260217/` folder in your team directory
